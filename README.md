Introduction

This project aims to build an emotional index score used to ascertain the outcomes of meetings or sessions with online users within the video conferencing space.  

The project idea came to light while on a video call interviewing a potential candidate; he was saying all the right things, but his expressions were saying something else sometimes. 

The possibility of measuring a candidate and assigning a score based on the interview's success was considered, with the intention of developing interaction ratings.

The latest trend is people working more and more remotely from different locations, which has increased the demand for video conferencing. Only a few visible statistics are being created based on meeting interactions. These meetings can range from professional consultations to employee meetings or even personal video calls. 

Through this project, the aim is to create a plug-in for video conferencing tools that offers the aforementioned score, enabling users to assess and measure the performance of their meetings.

The baseline for the product will be established, and the conceptual feasibility of this idea will be demonstrated. This will involve creating a model for emotional classification and sentiment analysis using deep learning models, which will be trained accordingly. The resulting outcomes of these models will be combined to generate the index score.

There is significant motivation for this project, with the primary focus being on the usability of the project/product. The term "project" and "product" will be used interchangeably, considering its ultimate transformation into a product. This project can be used in multiple industries and will significantly benefit if used correctly.

EmoReact: A Multimodal Approach and Dataset for Recognising Emotional Responses in Children [13]

The research paper introduces the EmoReact dataset, which captures multimodal data to recognise emotional responses in children. The proposed approach combines feature extraction and machine learning techniques to analyse the data and classify emotional responses. The research contributes to emotion recognition in children and has implications for various applications related to emotional understanding and development in this population.

NoldusHub: is an all-in-one platform for human behaviour studies designed to combine multiple measurements and easily achieve reliable, high-quality data and direct insights. [14]

The Noldus Observer software allows researchers to capture, record, and analyse behavioural data from different sources. It supports video recording and analysis, enabling researchers to observe and code behaviours systematically and reliably. The software also provides tools for synchronisation with physiological data, eye tracking, and other biometric measurements.
